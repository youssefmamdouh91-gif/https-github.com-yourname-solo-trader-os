"""
Component 2: Alt Breadth Participation (Weight: 20%)

Measures how broadly the altcoin market participates in the trend, the
crypto analog of "% of stocks above the 200DMA". Narrow markets (BTC up,
alts dead) are late-cycle or defensive; broad participation confirms
risk-on.

Input: dict of {symbol: [daily closes oldest -> newest]} for the tracked
alt universe (BTC excluded upstream). Coins with insufficient history are
skipped and reported.

Scoring (100 = broad participation):
  pct_above_200dma drives the base score:
    >= 80% -> 95    >= 65% -> 80    >= 50% -> 65
    >= 35% -> 45    >= 20% -> 25    <  20% -> 10

  50DMA confirmation modifier:
    pct_above_50dma >= pct_above_200dma + 15pts -> +5  (fresh thrust)
    pct_above_50dma <= pct_above_200dma - 15pts -> -5  (rolling over)
